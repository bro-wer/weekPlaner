Purpose
Purpose of this website is to learn myself Django by creating website that can be used to create weekly plans.
The idea for planner is to follow rules mentioned in the  "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey.

How should it work?
1) Determine your life roles (the long term targets to be achieved)
2) Categorize your goals (related to life roles) in to four groups (important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent)
3) Once a week sit down, review your goals and add them to your plan for the next week
4) Stick to the weekly plan


What is to be implemented?
1) scratch of the interface
2) view for roles
3) view for goals
4) view for the week that includes determined roles and goals (or maybe the goals only)
5) possibility to quickly add new goals
6) possibility to log in, set facourite settings
7) possibility to set email notifications

Where to start?
1) initial django project
2) start landing page
3) use TDD methodology
4) synchronize git with pythonanywhere
5) it would be probably the best to start with life roles sub-website
6) there should be some demo/tutorial as well
